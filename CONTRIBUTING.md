# WIKI Additions #
* When building a Wiki page item from scratch or editing an existing page look at the [TEMPLATE](https://github.com/hossimo/GMA3Plugins/wiki/TEMPLATE) to get the basic structure.
* Examples should be [minimal, complete and tested](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)

# Pull Requests #
No real structure here, but if you do find you self looking to submit a Pull Request:

* PRs should be a small and concice to sole the fewest number of issues.
* Try to minimize the amount of code changed.
* Try not to mix features and cleanup in the same PR (You may notice I am the worst at this)

Above all else, coding should be fun, everyone has diffrent skill and habits, but a good idea is a good idea!
